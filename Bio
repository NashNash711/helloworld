Knowing NOthing about computers or code has brought some embarrassment into my life, like wqhen I met my friend Andy and he asked me what a core was. I was very high , well I gotr very high and to;ld him that a core was the part of computer hardware that can control which dierection current flows through the memory, mnaking memory randon access. Fuck! He didn't even crack a smile! Fuck! At the time I thought I was right and shoewing off how intellient I was. I was demonsrating my intelligfwnce alright.
I might edit this laterff into several lines. Probably not.
